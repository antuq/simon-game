Functions
1. Start Game on Keypress

javascript

$(document).on("keypress", function () {
    if (!started) {
        started = true;
        $("#level-title").text("Level " + level);
        nextSequence();
    }
})

    Description: Listens for a keypress to start the game. Updates the level and initiates the first sequence.

2. Button Click Handler

javascript

$(".btn").on("click", function (event) {
    let userChosenColor = event.target.id;
    userClickedPattern.push(userChosenColor);

    checkAnswer(userClickedPattern.length - 1);

    playSound(userChosenColor);
    animatePress(userChosenColor);
})

    Description: Handles user clicks on the color buttons, checks if the user's input matches the game sequence, plays sound, and animates the button press.

3. Generate the Next Sequence

javascript

function nextSequence() {
    level++;
    $("#level-title").text("Level " + level);
    userClickedPattern = [];
    let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 4);
    let randomChosenColor = buttonColors[randomNumber]; 
    gamePattern.push(randomChosenColor);

    $(`#${randomChosenColor}`).fadeIn(100).fadeOut(100).fadeIn(100);
    playSound(randomChosenColor);
}

    Description: Generates a random color, adds it to the sequence, and updates the level. Also resets the user pattern for the new level.

4. Check User's Answer

javascript

function checkAnswer(currentLevel) {
    if (userClickedPattern[currentLevel] === gamePattern[currentLevel]) {
        if (userClickedPattern.length === gamePattern.length) {
            setTimeout(function () {
                nextSequence();
            }, 1000);
        } 
    } else { 
        playSound("wrong");
        $("body").addClass("game-over");
        $("h1").text("Game Over, Press Any Key to Restart");

        setTimeout(function (){
            $("body").removeClass("game-over");
        }, 200);

        startOver();
    }
}

    Description: Compares the user's input to the game sequence. If the sequence is correct, it continues to the next level. If not, it triggers the game over sequence.

5. Restart the Game

javascript

function startOver(){
    level = 0;
    gamePattern = [];
    started = false;
}

    Description: Resets the game variables to allow a fresh start after a game over.

6. Play Sound

javascript

function playSound(colorName) {
    let audio = new Audio("./sounds/" + colorName + ".mp3");
    audio.play();
}

    Description: Plays the corresponding sound for each color.

7. Animate Button Press

javascript

function animatePress(currentColor) {
    $(`#${currentColor}`).addClass("pressed");
    setTimeout(function () {
        $(`#${currentColor}`).removeClass("pressed");
    }, 100)
}
